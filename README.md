this project is a rock-paper-scissors game created as a part of my learning while completing the Odin Project.
Originally the game was javaScript console based but i have added UI as i learn more over time.
It's a simple game written with html, javaScript to add a bit of functionality as well as css for a bit of style.
The game is between a user and the computer with the being that who ever reaches 5 points first wins the game.
Normal rules of rock, paper, scissors apply.
